# Pomobear - The tool to be(ar) Effective

`pomobear` is a command line tool to help being focus & effective. It is based on the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). 

This project is a side-project and still in progress. Many things need to be added to fully apply the technique.

Of course, I could use one of the many excellent [similar app](https://github.com/topics/pomodoro) on GitHub, but building it is a great way of learning.

Advices, feedbacks and code reviews are welcomed.
